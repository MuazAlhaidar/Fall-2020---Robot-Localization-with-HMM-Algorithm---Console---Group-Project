\subsection*{Transitional Probability}
\label{sec:org7d7cbf4}
   \begin{math}
    Transitional\ Probability(Pos_i, Dir) = \\
     (Pos_{from\ left}:Drift(Left), Pos_{from\ straight}:Drift(Straight), Pos_{from\ right}:Drift(Right)): (\text{For smoothing})
\end{math}

\newline
\begin{math}
\\ \\
Transitional\ Probability(Pos_i, Dir) =\\ (Pos_{from\ left}:Drift(Left), Pos_{from\ straight}:Drift(Straight), Pos_{from\ right}:Drift(Right), Pos_{from\ behind}:Drift(Straight)): (\text{For prediction})
\\ \\
\end{math}


\emph{Left}, \emph{Right}, and \emph{Straight} are all positions defined in relation to what \emph{Dir} is: if \emph{Dir} is EAST, then \emph{Left} is SOUTH, \emph{Right} is NORTH, and Straight is EAST for example.

Here, transitional probability has two forms: one which is all paths that converge to a point, and another where they diverge from a point. Prediction (as the name implies) wants all the possible paths to a point, which is why we include \(Pos_{from\ behind}\). Smoothing however, does not use that, which is why it's not included.


\subsection*{Prediction}
\label{sec:org59a7289}
$$Prediction(Grid, Direction) = \left\{pos_i \in Grid \mid \sum_{(Pos_j, DriftProb)}^{Transition\ Probability(pos_i, direction)} DriftProb \cdot P(Pos_j) \right \}$$

\(Prediction(Grid, Direction)\) (as the name implies) attempts to predict where the agent will be given previous information. It does this by transforming the grid by the expression  \(\sum^{Transition\ Probability(pos_i, direction)}_{(Pos_j, DriftProb)} DriftProb \cdot P(Pos_j)\).This gets the probability of an agent drifting (or if direction is straight, accurately going to) a point, and what is the probability the agent would be at the point \(Pos_j\).


\subsection*{Evidence Conditional Probability}
\label{sec:org7e2fa92}
   \begin{math}
  Evidence\ Conditional\ Probability(Pos_i, Evidence)= \\
  \prod^{\text{Directions} }_{dir=W} Sense(evidence[pos_i dir], actual[pos_i+dir])
\end{math}

This is the expression we use to get the evidence conditional probability: it's the product of each the evidecne's value at a direction times what's actually in the value of the direction. So if \emph{Left} has opened, but evidence says it's closed, it's 0.2. Taking the product of all direction's sensed value and actual value, it will result in the Evidence Conditional Probability at \(Pos_i\) given \(Evidence\)

\subsection*{Filtering}
\label{sec:org2604945}


   \begin{math}
Filtering(Grid, Evidence) = \{pos_i \in Grid \mid\\
\frac{P(pos_i) \cdot Evidence\ Conditional\ Probability(pos_i, Evidence) }{\sum^{all\ positions}_{pos} P(pos_i) \cdot Evidence\ Conditional\ Probability(pos_i, evidence) } \}
\end{math}



Filtering is a transformation upon the grid: each value gets transformed by the expression \(\frac{P(pos_i) \cdot Evidence\ Conditional\ Probability(pos_i, Evidence) }{\sum^{all\ positions}_{pos} P(pos_i) \cdot Evidence\ Conditional\ Probability(pos_i, evidence) }\), which for purposes of making it easier to talk about, will be expressed as \(Filter\ Step(pos_i, Evidence)\). \(Filter\ Step\) is conditional probability of each point times what probabilty of the  point previously, and then dividing it  by the sum of all points on the grid.
